So Little Time, Yet, So Many PySpark Examples!

I love learning from examples. I've noticed that there's not a whole lot of examples of new things in Spark (like DataFrames, and they've been available for quite awhile). With what examples there are, there are fewer written in Python. Kind of gives you the blues if you want to learn this stuff, because, as it turns out, this Spark project is really great. You can handle large amounts of data with not a whole lot of code.

The aim of this repository is to provide you with fresh, practical examples in Spark. The examples are provided in .ipynb notebooks. I'll add new workflow examples every now and again.

Are you familiar with Spark? Then please contribute as I'll gladly accept PRs.
