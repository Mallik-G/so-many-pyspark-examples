So Little Time, Yet, So Many PySpark Examples!

I love learning from examples... fully worked out examples, that is. I've noticed that there's not a whole lot of examples of new things in Spark (like DataFrames, and they've been available for quite awhile). With what examples there are, there are fewer written in Python. Kind of gives you the blues if you want to learn this stuff, because, as it turns out, this Spark project is really great. You can handle large amounts of data with not a lot of code.

This repo, then, is a small contribution of examples. The aim is to give you something fresh, something practical. The examples are provided in .ipynb notebooks. Know Spark and wanna add something to this? Please do! I'll kindly accept PRs.
